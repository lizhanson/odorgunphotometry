# odorgunphotometry

Smellstim_treadmill is a script for running the Burton/Wachowiak odor gun adapted to arduino, recording/outputting stim timing, and recording output from the treadmill/mouse wheel then automatically saving odor presentation protocols/timing/wheel velocity. 

Other scripts are for processing photometry data obtained on the wheel with odor gun stimulation.
